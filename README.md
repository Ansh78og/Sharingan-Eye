# Sharingan-Eye
This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a real-time Sharingan eye animation that tracks your face. As you move, the pupils follow smoothly, with glowing effects and rotating tomoe. A background and overlay add depth, making it look like your eyes have awakened the Sharingan.
